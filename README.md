# yt-dl_bot
a small simple telegram bot to download videos from youtube using youtube-dl


I recommend you reading the (telegram bot-api docs)[https://core.telegram.org/] and taking a look at (python-telegram-bot)[https://python-telegram-bot.org/] before doing something with this code.
After cloning you only need to edit the settings.json file, insert your bottoken and paths and you can run the bot.py by using the interpreter or making it executable with chmod.
Have fun and may it be useful to you.

    **Note:** this code has only been tested with python 3.7.3 and needs atleast python 3.5 due to the use of subprocess.run
